Common HTML Bad Coding Practices,Proper Coding Practices
1. Missing Doctype Declaration,"Include a valid HTML doctype declaration at the beginning of your HTML document to define the document type (e.g., <!DOCTYPE html> for HTML5)."
2. Excessive Inline Styles,"Use external CSS files to define styles for HTML elements, separating content from presentation for easier maintenance."
3. Lack of Semantic HTML,"Employ semantic HTML elements (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <article>) for their intended purposes to provide a meaningful content structure."
4. Unclosed Tags,"Always close HTML tags properly, ensuring that every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag or use self-closing tags with a forward slash (e.g., <img src=""image.jpg"" />)."
5. Overuse of <br> Tags,"Use CSS properties (e.g., margin, padding) for spacing and layout instead of overusing <br> tags. Reserve <br> for breaking text within paragraphs."
6. Improper Nesting,Properly nest HTML elements to match the logical structure of the document and ensure opening and closing tags are correctly matched.
7. Inline JavaScript,Place JavaScript code in external .js files and link them using the <script> element for code reusability and maintainability.
8. Large Image Files,Optimize images by resizing and compressing them to reduce file size while maintaining quality and using appropriate image formats.
9. Tables for Layout,"Use HTML tables exclusively for tabular data and employ CSS (e.g., flexbox, grid) for layout design, avoiding tables for layout."
10. Ignoring Accessibility,"Ensure accessibility by providing descriptive alternative text for images, using proper heading structure, and implementing keyboard navigation as per web accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG)."
